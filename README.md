# Song-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a simple Music Recommendation System built in Python that provides song recommendations based on user preferences using a CSV file as input data.
## Features:
- Data-driven recommendations: The system suggests music based on attributes such as genre, artist, or user ratings.
- CSV file integration: The music data is stored in a CSV file, making it easy to update, expand, or modify.
- Personalized Suggestions: The system can generate recommendations tailored to a userâ€™s listening habits or preferences.
- Scalability: The system can handle a growing database of music tracks as new entries are added to the CSV file. 
## To Run the Recommendation System:
Once the CSV file is ready, you can run the script to get recommendations. The system will recommend songs based on the chosen filtering method.
+ "new.py" contains the Python code.
